# arrayMethods: A practice of DOM Array Methods.

## About
I was having a hard time remembering all of the DOM array methods (THERE ARE SO MANY!), so I decided to build this small app to help me master forEach(), reduce(), sort(), map(). and filter().  I used forEach() to loop through every person provided by the randomuser api, give them a random wealth, create a div while adding a class of person to them and adding appending each one as html code to the DOM. I used the reduce() to calculate the total by using an accumulator in to add up all the users and create a new div element with Total Wealth in the DOM. I used the sort() to sort all persons by their wealth. I used map() to double all user wealth. Lastly, I used the filter() to remove all persons that were not millionaires.

Thanks to this project I now feel far more confident with array methods and async functions.
